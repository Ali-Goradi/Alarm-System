# Alarm-System

       In this project, I will concentrate on how to improve the ordinary detector fire alarm system to be able to differentiate smoker cigarette and emergency case to send massage to firefighter through wireless communication (Half Duplex) by Bluetooth. To start with, to identify the situation weather it’s just smoking or emergency case, we need temperature sensor and gas sensor. the system works as following:
       
•	If the flame sensor detects, and the gas detect, then its emergency case.

•	If the gas sensor detects, while the flame sensor is not, it’s just smoking or cooking.
